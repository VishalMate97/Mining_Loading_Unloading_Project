Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the earth.

Mining in a wider sense includes extraction of any non-renewable resource such as petroleum, natural gas, or even water.

Mining techniques can be divided into two common excavation types: surface mining and sub-surface (underground) mining. 

Heavy machinery is used in mining to explore and develop sites, to remove and stockpile overburden, to break and remove rocks of various hardness and toughness, to process the ore, and to carry out reclamation projects after the mine is closed.

Bulldozers, drills, explosives and trucks are all necessary for excavating the land.

Large drills are used to sink shafts, excavate stopes, and obtain samples for analysis. 

Trams are used to transport miners, minerals and waste. 

Lifts carry miners into and out of mines, and move rock and ore out, and machinery in and out, of underground mines. 

Huge trucks, shovels and cranes are employed in surface mining to move large quantities of overburden and ore.

Once the mineral is extracted, it is often then processed.

Mineral processing (or mineral dressing) is a specialized area in the science of metallurgy that studies the mechanical means of crushing, grinding, and washing that enable the separation (extractive metallurgy) of valuable metals or minerals from their gangue (waste material).  

in loading unloading system four equipments are used eg.bulldozers,trucks,trams,cranes,lifts.

now we make the analysis on the loading of the ores from mining area and unloading in the specialized area in the science of metallurgy.
